## Problem Statement:

A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts. 
 
Geely Auto wants to understand the factors on which pricing of a car depends. They want to do this for the cars produced by the American and European countries, since their design is very different from the Chinese cars. Essentially the company wants to know:
1. Which variables are highly significant in estimating the price of a car
2. How well those important variables describe the price of a car

## Objective:

You are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for the management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
