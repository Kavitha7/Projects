## Problem statement:

“Global Mart” is an online store super giant having worldwide operations. It takes orders and delivers across the globe and deals with all the major product categories - consumer, corporate & home office. Global Mart wants to finalise the plan for the next 6 months.  So, it wants to forecast the sales and the demand for the next 6 months, that would help Global Mart manage the revenue and inventory accordingly.
 
## Objective:

The store caters to 7 different market segments and in 3 major categories. You want to forecast at this granular level, so you subset your data into 21 (7*3) buckets before analysing these data. But not all of these 21 market buckets are important from the store’s point of view. So you need to find out the most profitable (and consistent) segment from these 21 and forecast the sales and demand for the identified segment.
