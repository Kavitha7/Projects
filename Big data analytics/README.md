Problem Statement:

Amazon wants to start a new product line. It has three options of product categories to choose from - CDs and Vinyl, Movies and Ebooks (Kindle).
 
Specifically, you want to use the gigantic dataset to identify:
1.	Which product category has a larger market size
2.	Which product category is likely to be purchased heavily
3.	Which product category is likely to make the customers happy after the purchase

Since you do not have the actual sales data of the products, you will have to use some ‘proxy-metrics’ to estimate the aforementioned metrics.
