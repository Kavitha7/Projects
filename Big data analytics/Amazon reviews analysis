Problem Statement
 
Say you are a manager at a media company and want to start a new product line to boost your revenue. Being a media company, you want to get into either ebooks, movies, TV shows or similar such product categories in the entertainment industry. 
 
Since you are starting a new product line, you want to be sure about the choice of products you’ll buy (and sell). You have three options of product categories to choose from - CDs and Vinyl, Movies and Ebooks (Kindle).
 
Specifically, you want to use the gigantic dataset to identify:
1.	Which product category has a larger market size
2.	Which product category is likely to be purchased heavily
3.	Which product category is likely to make the customers happy after the purchase
Since you do not have the actual sales data of the products, you will have to use some ‘proxy-metrics’ to estimate the aforementioned metrics.
